# What is Ultima Underworld Portable?
Ultima Underworld Portable is a package made for the [GOG
version](https://www.gog.com/game/ultima_underworld_1_2) of Ultima Underworld 1 and 2, it includes an easy
to use launcher for both games, an updated version of the
original DOSbox called "DOSbox Staging", Roland MT-32 support 
for higher quality music and optional enhancement mods, the
most notable of them being the mouselook patch made by John Glassmyer
which rebinds the controls to modern standards and adds some Quality
of Life improvements to Ultima Underworld 1 and 2.

The other two minor mods included are a brazilian portuguese translation
made by Israel A. Possoli (translation only available for the first game) 
and a lights patch made by Gigaquad that increases the overall brightness
for both games.

# Installation

The package was made for the [GOG
version](https://www.gog.com/game/ultima_underworld_1_2) of both games, you can also use
files from the CD-ROM release but you will need to extract them manually
inside "data/game".

The installation process is very simple, you only need the "game.gog" file
that's in your GOG installation and put it next to "Extractor.exe", then
you start the extractor and it will automatically configure everything for
you.

After the game is installed you can launch UWPortable.exe to play the games
and configure the mods from your liking.

# Compiling launcher batch files

Compiling the launcher .bat files is not necessary, but if you want to have a compiled exe file with an icon you can
use the Bat To Exe Converter found here:
